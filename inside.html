        The moment you've entered the house you knew you've made a mistake. There is no light since there are no windows. There is a chair in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p style="color: lightgreen">You: What is...that? A chair? I can barely see anything...I need to see, I need light. *Turned on flashlight* Much better. Is that...IS THAT...a deadbody. *vomits*</p>
    <p style="color: khaki">You try to get out of there. But it was too late. The killer is behind you.</p>
    <h2 style="color: red">DEATH</h2>
