My name is Jason. At least, that's what they tell me. I have a wife, Emma, and two beautiful children, Lily and Max. They are my world now, even though I don't remember how we became a family. My story is a patchwork of memories, some mine, some told to me by others. </p>
<br />
<p style="color: orange;">
Years ago, I was in a car accident that left me in a coma. While I lay unconscious, my parents passed away. The doctors said it was natural causes, but the timing felt like a cruel twist of fate. I was their only child, and they died without me ever knowing, without a chance to say goodbye. </p>
<br />
<p style="color: pink;">
When I woke from the coma, the world I returned to was unrecognizable. My parents were gone, and the grief I felt was overwhelming. It was as if a part of me had died with them. The depression was deep, a dark abyss that I couldn't escape. One night, in a moment of utter despair, I tried to end my life. But Emma found me just in time.
